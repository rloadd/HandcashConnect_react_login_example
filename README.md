## About de functionality

This is an example that ask a handcash user for an authorization and query their profile. For a little improvement, the session remains in the browser thanks to the use of localStorage to store some data.

## Pre-requisites

Follow [this instructions](https://docs.handcash.dev/authorization/) on how to get an **AppId** and to setup a pair of callbacks to integrate the app with HC. Replace the **AppId** in the example with your own one. It is needed just **profile** access (not payment auth, nothing more).


## How to run it

In dev mode, 


```
npm i
npm start
```
